# RLSnakeGame
Implemented a Deep Q-Learning algorithm using PyTorch and Numpy to play the classic game snake.
This was my first attempt at implementing an approximate method that does not directly store the
State, Action table that is present in many other RL Algorithms. 

I implemented this start to finish in the 26th of November, though the idea of solving Snake using
an RL agent came to me the day or two before. 

### Dependencies
* `Python >= 3.11`
* `Numpy >= 1.26.1`
* `Torch >= 2.1.0+cpu`
* `IPython >= 8.18.0`

### Usage
Once proper dependencies are installed, one can run `agent.py` from the terminal and the training
visualisation will begin.
